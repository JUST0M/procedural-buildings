# The following function splits some number of operations 'randomly' between a set of operations

    # Assign some number of primitives to each child such that the total number of
    # assigned primitives is M and each child has no more than P primitives assigned.
# To generate a truly random assignment is complicated
# see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8064629/random-numbers-that-add-to-100-matlab/8068956#8068956
# for a discussion.
# So we use a non-uniform verison that just generates the number of primitives assigned to each child on
# the fly.
